```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid
```
                    [E2E Tests]
                   (10% - Critical paths)
                  
              [Integration Tests] 
             (20% - Service interactions)
            
         [Unit Tests]
        (70% - Individual components)
```

### Testing Types
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual function/method testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service communication
3. **Contract Tests**: API contract validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
5. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning
6. **Chaos Tests**: Failure scenario simulation

### Test Data Management
```javascript
// Example test data setup
class TestDataBuilder {
  static createUser(overrides = {}) {
    return {
      id: uuid(),
      username: `testuser_${Date.now()}`,
      email: `test_${Date.now()}@example.com`,
      score: 0,
      ...overrides
    };
  }
  
  static createScoreUpdate(userId, increment = 100) {
    return {
      userId,
      actionType: 'GAME_COMPLETION',
      scoreIncrement: increment,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      sessionId: uuid()
    };
  }
}
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Progression
```
Development → Feature Branch Testing → Staging → Production
```

### Deployment Patterns
1. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
2. **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout to subset of users
3. **Feature Flags**: Toggle functionality without deployment

### Rollback Strategy
```yaml
Rollback Triggers:
  - Error rate > 5%
  - Response time > 1000ms (p95)
  - Critical bug reports
  - Failed health checks

Rollback Process:
  1. Immediate traffic switch to previous version
  2. Investigate and fix issues
  3. Deploy fixed version
  4. Gradual traffic restoration
```

## Performance Requirements

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
```yaml
Availability: 
  - Target: 99.9% uptime
  - Measurement: HTTP 200 responses / total requests

Latency:
  - Target: p95 < 200ms for score updates
  - Target: p99 < 500ms for all API calls

Throughput:
  - Target: 1000 score updates/second
  - Target: 10,000 concurrent WebSocket connections

Real-time Updates:
  - Target: Updates delivered within 1 second
  - Target: 99.9% message delivery success rate
```

### Load Testing Scenarios
```javascript
// K6 load testing script example
import http from 'k6/http';
import ws from 'k6/ws';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 },   // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },   // Stay at 100 users
    { duration: '2m', target: 200 },   // Ramp up to 200 users
    { duration: '5m', target: 200 },   // Stay at 200 users
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },     // Ramp down
  ],
};

export default function() {
  // Score update test
  let response = http.post('https://api.scoreboard.com/v1/scores', {
    actionType: 'GAME_COMPLETION',
    scoreIncrement: 100
  }, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + __ENV.JWT_TOKEN }
  });
  
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 200ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 200,
  });
}
```
