## üéØ Migration Decision Matrix

### When to Migrate from SQLite

| Metric | Stay with SQLite | Plan Migration | Urgent Migration |
|--------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Users** | < 500 concurrent | 500-1,000 | > 1,000 |
| **DB Size** | < 1 GB | 1-5 GB | > 5 GB |
| **Response Time** | < 200ms P95 | 200-500ms P95 | > 500ms P95 |
| **Error Rate** | < 1% | 1-5% | > 5% |
| **Write Load** | < 50 writes/sec | 50-100 writes/sec | > 100 writes/sec |

### Database Technology Recommendations

**PostgreSQL** (Recommended for most cases)
- Best migration path from SQLite
- Excellent TypeORM support
- ACID compliance with high performance
- JSON support for flexibility
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks migration

**MySQL** (Alternative option)
- Slightly better write performance
- Large ecosystem and community
- Good for high-transaction workloads
- Timeline: 3-6 weeks migration

**MongoDB** (For document-heavy workloads)
- Best for JSON/document storage
- Horizontal scaling built-in
- Good for rapid development
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks migration

## üìä Cost-Benefit Analysis

### ROI of Migration Investment

```
SQLite Limitations:
- Max practical users: 1,000-2,000
- Performance degradation beyond 1GB
- Single-writer bottleneck
- Limited scaling options

PostgreSQL Benefits:
- 50x+ user capacity increase
- 10x+ performance improvement  
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Production-grade reliability

Investment Timeline:
- Month 1-2: SQLite optimization ($200 investment)
- Month 3-4: PostgreSQL migration ($1,000 investment)  
- Month 5-6: Production scaling ($2,000 investment)

Break-even Analysis:
- Current limit: ~1,000 users
- Post-migration capacity: ~50,000 users
- Break-even point: When user base > 2,000 users
- ROI: 50x capacity increase for 3x infrastructure cost
